Youtube App version 1.0.0  
Uses the Microsoft C#.Net 4.5 framework


The project started on March 13, 2013, when I decided I  
was tired of searching through multiple tabs and windows  
on my prefered web browser to view youtube videos.  I  
figured it would be a good reason to learn how to use wpf.  
It has been a great experience for me, and I find this  
one of the only projects I've made that I actually use,  
so I thought I would share it with the world.  

This application makes use of the ![MahApps.Metro toolkit](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/).
